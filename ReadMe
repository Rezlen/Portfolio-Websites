Project is hosted on Github but Github do not display Login/out or signup pages that is why the project is also hosted on NETLIFY with my own domain; https://app.netlify.com/teams/rezlen/overview https://rezasoheily.co.uk/
SignIn/Up authentication & database is hosted on Google's FireBase

Jquery has been used for Menu Toggle/ mobile etc.

The website is hosted on Gitub but synchornised to Netlify to be displayied live. Because it has JS & database, it could not be displayied on GitHub alone.
Now it is on Gtub but sinked with Netlify so it can be displayed PLUST free SSL & my own domain has been added through Netlify.

The current database is FireBase NoSQL but iti is going to be changed to SQL & both database & codes be stored on Heroku because only Heroku allows hosting free DB as well.
MySQL will be automatickally synced to my VS Code & on my Local PHPMyAdmin. 
Xampp has been installed to handle PHPMyAdmin.
Xampp has been installed NOT on my C drive but on D drive, that was a challenge as well since its defult PORT must be changed from 3306 to 3307 which I found out by hours of search.
